 Description:

 BU is a program that makes keeping all of your user data safely backed up on
 a dedicated External USB drive easy.

 BU will update files that have changed, remove files that have been
 deleted and add any new files that have been created since the last backup.
 The initial backup can take a lot of time if you have a lot of data stored
 in your system's /home directory. BU creates a directory with the host name
 of the machine it's backing up from inside BU_Backups. This allows users to
 share one BU_Drive with multiple machines.

 The directory structure and all files are stored openly to allow users easy
 access if they only need to retrieve a few files or directories using a file
 manager.

 The BU Restore function is an interactive tool that lets users restore their
 /home directories to a previous state. This function will only work when
 restoring to a machine with the exact same hostname as the one the backups were
 made from. It is intended for emergency use, as when significant number of
 directories and files are accidentally removed from /home.

_DESCRIPTION_

drive_setup() {
	cat << _SETUP_
 BU_Drive Setup:

 You need to prepare a BU Drive with a tool like Gparted or Gnone Disks.
 This can be any USB storage device. The dedicated USB drive MUST contain a
 partition formatted with a Linux native file system such as Ext4 or XFS. The
 partition MUST be labeled "BU_Drive" so BU can find it and use it for backups.
 The partition needs to have enough free capacity to store all data in /home on
 all of the machines you want to use the drive for. Note: The script will only
 allow media formatted with Ext4 or XFS. Non-native file systems like FAT32 or
 NTFS will cause the script to exit with an error.
