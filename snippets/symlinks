# Basic syntax
ln -s <path to the file/folder to be linked> <the path of the link to be created>


# Create a symbolic link from gitea/scripts/ to bin
ln -s gitea/scripts/ bin

# Symlink to a file:
ln -s /home/james/transactions.txt trans.txt
ln -s /home/james/transactions.txt my-stuffs/trans.txt

# Symlink to a folder:
ln -s /home/james james

# Remove a symlink:
ls -l <path-to-assumed-symlink>
unlink <path-to-symlink>
rm <path-to-symlink>
rm trans.txt
rm james

The main benefit of rm over unlink is that you can remove multiple symlinks at once, like you can with files.

# Find broken links:
find /home/james -xtype l 	# This will list all broken symlinks in the james directory â€“ from files to directories to sub-directories.
find /home/james -xtype l -delete		# Delete broken links
