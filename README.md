## Function Library

The `functionlib` script is a collection of commonly used functions which I use in most of my scripts. To use it, simply source it near the begining of the script. Since I use Shellcheck as my linter, I include directives to tell Shellcheck the location of the script and to disable the error message it gives about it. To use it, place the following code directory beneath the header information:
```bash
## Shellcheck Directives ##
# shellcheck source=/home/rick/bin/functionlib
# shellcheck disable=SC1091 # Disabling SC1091 is not required if using shellcheck -x to check syntax.

## Source function library ##

if [[ -x "$HOME/bin/functionlib" ]]; then
  source "$HOME/bin/functionlib"
else
  printf "\e[91mERROR:\e[0m functionlib not found!\n" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

## Directories

### cronjobs

Scripts that are run as cron jobs.

### files

Support files called by scripts. These files include sed scripts, audio files, and files to be appended or prepended to other files.

### functions

Supporting documentation for functions contained in `functionlib`, `.bashrc`, abd `.bash_aliases` files. The directory also contains examples of routines I commonly use in my scripts that are not in functions.
