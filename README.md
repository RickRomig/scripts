# scripts

## Description

This repository contains Bash scripts I use on my local network, along with support files, templates, and documentation.

Support files called by scripts. These files include sed scripts, audio files, and files to be appended or prepended to other files.

### `functions` directory

Supporting documentation for the functions contained in the `functionlib` collection of functions and functions in my `.bash_aliases` file. The directory also contains examples of routines I commonly use in my scripts.

### `snippets` directory

Code snippets and code examples.

### `Templates` directory

- Templates script and source code files, scripts, C/C++ source code, and open-source licenses.
- ASCII art images for `neofetch`.
