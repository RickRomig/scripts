## Function Library

The `functionlib` script is a collection of commonly used functions used in many of my scripts. To use it, simply source it near the begining of the script.  Ideally, the `functionlib` script should be located in `~/bin`.

### Shellcheck

If you use Shellcheck to check syntax, include Shellcheck directives to tell Shellcheck the location of the script and to disable the error message it gives about it. Place the following Shellcheck directies directly beneath the header information:
```bash
## Shellcheck Directives ##
# shellcheck source=/home/rick/bin/functionlib
# shellcheck disable=SC1091
```
Disabling SC1091 is not required if using shellcheck -x to check syntax.
If running outside the `~/bin` directory, change the path in the directive. Use the full path, i.e., `/home/username/script_directory`.

### Sourcing the function library

Source `functionlib` before any any other code. Edit the path if running from a directory other than `~/bin`.
```bash
if [[ -x "$HOME/bin/functionlib" ]]; then
  source "$HOME/bin/functionlib"
else
  printf "\e[91mERROR:\e[0m functionlib not found!\n" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

## Directories

### cronjobs

Contains scripts that are run as user or system cron jobs.

### files

Contains support files called by scripts. These files include sed scripts, audio files, and files to be appended or prepended to other files.

### functions

Supporting markdown documentation for functions contained in `functionlib`, `.bashrc`, and `.bash_aliases` files. The directory also contains examples of commonly used routines in my scripts that are not in functions.

### snippets

Contains markdown files of code snippets and code examples.

### Templates

Contains templates for shell scripts, C/C++ source code, configuration files, and open-source licenses.
